# IsoBERT
Hi! Welcome to the IsoBERT repository.

Most of the pertinent information can be found here at: site](https://rjha18.github.io/IsoBERT/).

This repo is mostly just website files but in the docs folder you can find a PowerPoint we made and a .ipynb version of the Colab found here: [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-8NoW_xl11XPS_XkUOvzDlXLzuUnk3kk?usp=sharing).
