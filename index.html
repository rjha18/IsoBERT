        <h3 class="fw-light">Abstract</h3>
        <p class="lead text-muted">DistilBERT embeddings improve upon their widely used predecessor (BERT) by creating similarly performing embeddings that are "smaller, faster, cheaper and lighter"[CITE]. However, at 768 dimensions, the embeddings themselves can be prohibitively large. For this project we investigated the effects of linear (Kernel and standard PCA) and non-linear (IsoMAP) dimensionality reduction on DistilBERT embeddings, reducing to 128 and 16 dimensions. We find that in many cases, for text classification and sentiment analysis tasks, 16-dimensional, IsoMAP/PCA reduced DistilBERT embeddings often performed similarly or better when compared to 16 dimensional PCA-reduced embeddings, 128 dimensional PCA-reduced embeddings, and the original embeddings. These results show promise for a novel geometric approach to achieve lower dimensional text embeddings and pave way for data and application specific manifold reductions.</p>
